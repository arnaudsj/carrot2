PROBLEM:
	Corrupted national characters in the Web form (remote controller)

WHERE:
	Remote controller deployed on Tomcat5 (and possibly later) container.
	
DESCRIPTION:
	National characters are UTF-8 encoded in Carrot2, but Tomcat decodes
	them using local platform's encoding.
	
WORKAROUND:
	Force correct decoding on the connector level. Add the following attribute
	to the "Connector" section of Tomcat's master configuration file (server.xml):

	URIEncoding="UTF-8"
	
	An example connector should look like this:
	
        <Connector port="8080"
            maxThreads="25" minSpareThreads="5" maxSpareThreads="10"
            minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="25" enableLookups="false"
            redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="10" debug="0" connectionTimeout="20000" 
            URIEncoding="UTF-8" />
