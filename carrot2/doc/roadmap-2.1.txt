
A roadmap to release 2.1
------------------------

Nice to have:

- Add a "Show in clusters" feature to the webapp, which will highlight all
  clusters in the tree to which the selected document belongs

- Implement the "more..." tab in the webapp, so that we can add much more new
  data sources (MSN, *.gov.pl)

- Extend the "Search with Carrot2" section to add options similar
  to those on Clusty: http://clusty.com/sitesearch. Add information about
  the possibility to link directly to the iframes with the results?

- Move command line applications from the commercial repository to
  the OS repository (D)

- (webapp) decrease the number of synchronizations in the broadcaster.

- Add OpenSearch Descriptor support for carrot2-input-opensearch?

- Unify coding style (reformat existing code)

- Check out Unicode segmentation spec (info from Andrzej Zydro):
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/tr29-10.html

- refactor Language use (tokenization, stemming) in Lingo.

- Highlight user search terms in document snippets in the local demo application (reuse
Lucene's highlighter?).

- A plugin for SOLR?
  http://incubator.apache.org/solr/

- Write a clustering plugin for Kneobase?
