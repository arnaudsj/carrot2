
A roadmap to release 2.1
------------------------

Must have:

- correct query time statistics to return an average in a time window of 5 minutes.

Nice to have:

- Add a "Show in clusters" feature to the webapp, which will highlight all
  clusters in the tree to which the selected document belongs

- Implement the "more..." tab in the webapp, so that we can add much more new
  data sources (MSN, *.gov.pl)

- Add metasearch input component (in this case the on-line demo could have
  tabs like "Web", "Wiki", "Jobs" etc.)

- Extend the "Search with Carrot2" section to add options similar
  to those on Clusty: http://clusty.com/sitesearch. Add information about
  the possibility to link directly to the iframes with the results?

- Move command line applications from the commercial repository to
  the OS repository (D)

- Add support for snippet extraction to the LuceneInputComponent (based on
  Lucene Highlighter)? Ideally, there would be a configuration switch that
  would decide if the summary should be initialized from a Lucene field as 
  it was, or the summary should be initialized with a "snippet" of the
  specified field.

- (webapp) AJAX-based tracking of the clusters the users choose to inspect
  This could be an interesting source of statistics, potentially useful for
  improving/ promoting certain clusters in the future. Implementation:
  when the user clicks on a cluster label (for the first time only?), make
  a background XmlHTTPRequest to send to the server: the query, the cluster
  label (+ parent labels?), the rank of the cluster?, the number of documents
  in the cluster? An even more interesting feature would be to track clicks on 
  documents (a cluster whose documents have not been clicked is worse than a
  cluster whose documents have been clicked).

- (webapp) decrease the number of synchronizations in the broadcaster.

- Add OpenSearch Descriptor support for carrot2-input-opensearch?

- Unify coding style (reformat existing code)

- Check out Unicode segmentation spec (info from Andrzej Zydro):
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/tr29-10.html

- refactor Language use (tokenization, stemming) in Lingo.

- Highlight user search terms in document snippets in the local demo application (reuse
Lucene's highlighter?).

- A plugin for SOLR?
  http://incubator.apache.org/solr/

- Write a clustering plugin for Kneobase?
