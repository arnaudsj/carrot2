     * <h1>Carrot<sup>2</sup> API example</h1>
     * 
     * <h2>Introduction</h2>
     * 
     * <p>Carrot<sup>2</sup> is composed of <b>components</b> bound together
     * in a <b>processing chain</b>. To start clustering search results
     * we will need at least three components:</p>
     * 
     * <ul>
     *  <li><b>input</b> - anything that produces <b>snippets</b> to be 
     *  clustered. Each snippet consists of a unique URL, a title and
     *  a fragment of text from the content of a document. Example input
     *  components available in Carrot<sup>2</sup> provide bridges to
     *  existing major search engines (Yahoo, Google), open source
     *  search engines (Lucene), but also adapt XMLs (such as RSS or OpenSearch).
     *  As a final resort, you can try to write your own input component
     *  using the examples available in the project.</li>
     *   
     *  <li><b>filters</b> - typically a clustering component and a set
     *  of filters that it requires. Carrot<sup>2</sup> comes with a number
     *  of clustering components; each one implements a different algorithm
     *  and has different requirements concerning configuration and previous
     *  filters in the processing chain. You'll need to take a look at the
     *  demo applications (web application and local application) - there
     *  are full scripts configuring each clustering component there. In this
     *  example we will use <b>Lingo</b> clustering component and configure
     *  it directly from the source code.</li>
     *  
     *  <li><b>output</b> - a clustering component typically produces instances
     *  of {@link RawCluster}. The role of an output component is to do something
     *  with clusters once you receive them from the clusterer. The easiest
     *  way is to save them in an array and wait until all the processing is
     *  finished (all the clusters are available). A more advanced application
     *  could use (display?) clusters as soon as they appear from the clustering
     *  component. In this example we will buffer the output clusters in 
     *  an array. 
     *  </li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * 
     * <h2>Initialization</h2>
     * 
     * <p>The next step after deciding which components to use is to
     * create an instance of a {@link LocalController} which provides
     * the facility for executing queries and assembling a fully
     * functional processing chain. This is explained in {@link #initLocalController()}
     * method.</p>
     * 
     * 
     * <h2>Running queries</h2>
     * 
     * <p>Once you have a fully configured {@link LocalController}, running
     * queries is quite trivial. The only thing you need to do is to invoke
     * {@link LocalController#query(String, String, java.util.Map)} method,
     * passing it a process identifier, a query and a {@link Map} of 
     * request parameters. These parameters can be used by certain components
     * to alter their behaviour or settings <b>for the duration of a single
     * query</b>. Each component will expose a different set of parameters,
     * so you'll need to take a look at source code to see what is available.
     * </p>
     * 
     * <p>Note that an instance of a {@link LocalController} is thread-safe
     * and may (should!) be reused.</p>
     * 
     * <p>The result of running a query is an instance of a {@link ProcessingResult}
     * interface. The actual output depends a lot on the last (output) component
     * in the chain, so you'll need to see what is available. In our case, the
     * result is a buffered array of snippets and clusters of type
     * {@link Result}. We can display
     * documents (snippets) and clusters by fetching data from this
     * object. This procedure is shown in 
     * {@link #displayResults(ArrayOutputComponent.Result)} method.</p>
     *
     *
     * <h2>Cleanup</h2>
     * No special cleanup is necessary when you close your application. Just let
     * the garbage collector consume the resources taken by {@link LocalController}.
     * 
     * 
     * <h2>Other things to look at</h2>
     * This example configures the controller in a very "manual", step-by-step way
     * to explain how things in Carrot<sup>2</sup> work. In the Web and local demo
     * applications, however, you'll see that components and processes can be
     * instantiated semi-automatically using Beanshell scripts and component
     * autodiscovery. These are more advanced topics, refer to the source code
     * of demo applications and JUnit test cases for details.
     * 
     * 
     * @param args Command line arguments are not used in this application.

     * chains (components) for the execution of each query, controls the process of
     * its execution and in general is the heart of Carrot<sup>2</sup>

     * <ul>
     *  <li><b>input:</b> we will fetch results from Yahoo search engine,</li>

     * </ul>

     * <p>For each component, we must create a {@link ComponentFactory} and add it

     * string identifier. This identifier is reused later when you assemble a {@link LocalProcess}.</p>
     * 
     * <p>A {@link Process} contains all the information about input, filters and output components.
     * processes are also identified with a unique string identifier. Note that one controller
     * may contain <b>more than one</b> process. So, for example, you could create a controller
     * that runs two different processing chains, one querying Yahoo and the other one Google.</p>
