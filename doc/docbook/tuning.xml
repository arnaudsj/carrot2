  <subtitle>Fine-tuning &PROD; clustering</subtitle>

  <para>
    This chapter discusses a number of typical fine-tuning scenarios for &PROD; clustering
    algorithms. Some of the scenarios are relevant to all &PROD; algorithms, while others
    are specific to individual algorithms.

    <title>Desirable characteristics of documents for clustering</title>
    
    <para>
      The quality of clusters and their labels largely depends on the 
      characteristics of documents provided on the input. Although there is no general
      rule for optimum document content, below are some tips worth considering.
    </para>

          <para>
            The most important characteristic of &PROD; algorithms to keep in mind is
            that they perform in-memory clustering. For this reason, as a rule of
            thumb, &PROD; should successfully deal with up to a thousand of
            documents, a few paragraphs each. For algorithms designed to process
            millions of documents, you may want to check out the 
            <link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/mahout/">Mahout</link> project.

          <para>
            &PROD; clustering algorithms will work best with a set of documents similar
            to what is normally returned by a typical search engine. While about 20 is the
            minimum number of documents you can reasonably cluster, the optimum would fall
            in the 100 &ndash; 500 range.

          <para>
            If the input documents are a result of some search query, provide
            contextual snippets related to that query, similar
            to what web search engines return, instead of full document content. Not only
            will this speed up processing, but also should help the clustering
            algorithm to cover the full spectrum of topics dealt with in the search results.

        <formalpara>
          <title>Minimize "noise" in the input documents.</title>
          
          <para>
            All kinds of "noise" in the documents, such as truncated sentences (sometimes resulting from 
            contextual snippet extraction suggested above) or random alphanumerical strings
            may decrease the quality of cluster labels. If you have access to e.g. a few
            sentences' abstract of each document, it is worth checking the quality of 
            clustering based on those abstracts. If you can combine this with the
            previous tip, i.e. extract complete sentences matching user's query, this
            should improve the clusters even further.

        Let us once again stress that there are no definite generic guidelines for

        your specific application on &PROD; mailing list and ask for advice.

  <section xml:id="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.stop-words">
    <title>Modifying the list of stop words</title>
    
    <para>
      Stop words are the common meaningless words, such as <emphasis>the</emphasis>, 
      <emphasis>to</emphasis>, <emphasis>for</emphasis> in English, that should be 
      ignored while clustering. The Lingo algorithm, for example, will not create
      clusters whose labels start or end in a stop word.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      To fine-tune the stop words list you can use the 
      <link linkend="section.workbench">&DCW;</link> in the following way:

          the directory to which you extracted &DCW;. Modify the <filename>stopwords.*</filename>

          for English). Add or remove stop words as required and save changes.

  <section xml:id="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.stop-regexps">
    <title>Excluding specific clusters from results</title>
    
    <para>
      The Lingo clustering algorithm, in addition to 
      <link linkend="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.stop-words">stop words editing</link>,
      offers more precise control over cluster labels by means of "stop label" regular expressions. 
      If a cluster's label matches one of the stop labels, the label will not appear 
      on the list of clusters produced by Lingo.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The procedure for tuning stop labels and transferring them to other &C2; applications is similar to 
      <link linkend="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.stop-words">stop word tuning</link>.
      The difference is that this time you need to edit the <filename>stoplabels.*</filename> files.
      Each line of a stop labels file corresponds to one stop label and is a <link xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java regular
      expression</link>. Please note that in order to be removed, a label <emphasis>as a whole</emphasis> must match 
      at least one of the stop label expressions. A number of example
      stop label expressions are shown below.
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>(?i)new
(?i)information
(?i)information (about|on).*
(?i)(index|list) of.*</programlisting>

    <para>
      All stop labels shown above start with the <tag>(?i)</tag> prefix, which enables 
      case-insensitive matching for them. The stop label in the first line suppresses 
      labels consisting solely of the word <emphasis>new</emphasis>. Similarly, the stop label
      in the second line removes labels consisting of the word <emphasis>information</emphasis>.
      The stop label in the third line removes labels that start in <emphasis>information about</emphasis>
      or <emphasis>information on</emphasis>, and the stop label in the fourth line removes
      labels that start with <emphasis>index of</emphasis> or <emphasis>list of</emphasis>. 
    </para>
    
    <note>
      <para>
        Please note that defining a very large number of stop labels (100+) may 
        significantly slow down clustering. In such cases you may want to combine
        separate stop label expressions into one larger regular expression.

  <section xml:id="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.reducing-other-topics">
    <title>Reducing the size of the <emphasis>Other Topics</emphasis> cluster</title>
    
    <para>
      The <emphasis>Other Topics</emphasis> cluster contains documents that do not belong
      to any other cluster generated by the algorithm. Depending on the input documents, the size of
      this cluster may vary from a few to tens of documents.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      By tuning parameters of the clustering algorithm, you can reduce the number of
      unclustered documents, however bringing the number down to 0 is unachievable in most cases.
      Please note that minimizing the <emphasis>Other Topics</emphasis> cluster size is usually achieved
      by forcing the algorithm to create more clusters, which may degrade the perceived
      clustering quality.
