    <title>Fine-tuning &C2; clustering</title>
    
    <para>
      This section discusses a number of typical fine-tuning scenarios for &C2; clustering
      algorithms. Some of the scenarios are relevant to all &C2; algorithms, while others
      are specific to individual algorithms.

    <section xml:id="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.stop-words">
      <title>Modifying the list of stop words</title>
      
      <para>
        Stop words are the common meaningless words, such as <emphasis>the</emphasis>, 
        <emphasis>to</emphasis>, <emphasis>for</emphasis> in English, that should be 
        ignored while clustering. The Lingo algorithm, for example, will not create
        clusters whose labels start or end in a stop word.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To fine-tune the stop words list you can use the 
        <link linkend="section.workbench">&DCW;</link> in the following way:
      </para>
      
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Start &DCW; and run some query on which you'll be observing the results
            of your changes.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Go to the <filename>workspace/</filename> directory which is located in
            the directory to which you extracted &DCW;. Modify the <filename>stopwords.*</filename>
            file for the language you are working on (e.g. <filename>stopwords.en</filename>
            for English). Add or remove stop words as required and save changes.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Open the <guilabel>Attributes</guilabel> view in &DCW; and use the view's toolbar
            button shown in <xref linkend="figure.preprocessing-attributes" /> 
            to group the attributes by semantics. In the <guilabel>Preprocessing</guilabel>
            make sure the <guilabel>Processing language</guilabel> is correctly set and
            check the <guilabel>Reload stopwords</guilabel> checkbox. Doing the latter
            will let you to see the updated clustering results without restarting &DCW;
            every time you save the changed stop word list.

            option in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> menu. To rerun clustering after
            you've saved changes to the <filename>stopwords.*</filename>, choose the
            <guilabel>Restart Clustering</guilabel> option from the <guilabel>Search</guilabel>
            menu, or press <guilabel>Ctrl+F11</guilabel>.

          To transfer the changed stop words file to other &C2; applications, update
          the existing stop words file in the <filename>carrot2-core.jar</filename> the application

      <title>Excluding specific clusters from results</title>
      
      <para>
        The Lingo clustering algorithm, in addition to 
        <link linkend="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.stop-words">stop words editing</link>,
        offers more precise control over cluster labels by means of "stop label" regular expressions. 
        If a cluster's label matches one of the stop labels, the label will not appear 
        on the list of clusters produced by Lingo.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The procedure for tuning stop labels and transferring them to other &C2; applications is similar to 
        <link linkend="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.stop-words">stop word tuning</link>.
        The difference is that this time you need to edit the <filename>stoplabels.*</filename> files.
        Each line of a stop labels file corresponds to one stop label and is a <link xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java regular
        expression</link>. Please note that in order to be removed a label <emphasis>as a whole</emphasis> must match 
        at least one of the stop label expressions. A number of example
        stop label expressions are shown below.
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>(?i)new
(?i)information
(?i)information (about|on).*
(?i)(index|list) of.*</programlisting>

      <para>
        All stop labels shown above start with the <tag>(?i)</tag> prefix, which enables 
        case-insensitive matching for them. The stop label in the first line suppresses 
        labels consisting solely of the word <emphasis>new</emphasis>. Similarly, the stop label
        in the second line removes labels consisting of the word <emphasis>information</emphasis>.
        The stop label in the third line removes labels that start in <emphasis>information about</emphasis>
        or <emphasis>information on</emphasis>, and the stop label in the fourth line removes
        labels that start with <emphasis>index of</emphasis> or <emphasis>list of</emphasis>. 
      </para>
      
      <note>
        <para>
          Please note that defining a very large number of stop labels (100+) may 
          significantly slow down clustering. In such cases you may want to combine
          separate stop label expressions into one larger regular expression.

    <section xml:id="section.advanced-topics.fine-tuning.reducing-other-topics">
      <title>Reducing the size of the <emphasis>Other Topics</emphasis> cluster</title>
      
      <para>
        The <emphasis>Other Topics</emphasis> cluster contains documents that do not belong
        to any other cluster generated by the algorithm. Depending on the input documents, the size of
        this cluster may vary from a few to tens of documents.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        By tuning parameters of the clustering algorithm, you can reduce the number of
        unclustered documents, however bringing the number down to 0 is unachievable in most cases.
        Please note that minimizing the <emphasis>Other Topics</emphasis> cluster size is usually achieved
        by forcing the algorithm to create more clusters, which may degrade the perceived
        clustering quality.
