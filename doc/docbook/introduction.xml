  <subtitle>What is &PROD; and what it is not</subtitle>

  <para>
    &PROD; is a library and a set of supporting applications you can use to build
    a search results clustering engine. Such an engine will <emphasis
    role="bold">organize your search results into topics</emphasis>, fully
    automatically and without external kowledge such as taxonomies or
    preclassified content.
  </para>

  <para>
    &PROD; contains two document clustering algorighms designed specifically for
    search results clustering: Suffix Tree Clustering and Lingo.
    &PROD; also contains components for fetching search results from several search
    engines, such as Yahoo!, MSN Live, Google, but it also supports other
    sources of documents like Lucene, Solr or Google Desktop index. 
  </para>

  <para>
    &PROD; <emphasis role="bold">is not a search engine</emphasis> itself, it
    does not have a crawler and indexer. There is a number of Open Source projects
    you can use to crawl (<link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/">Nutch</link>), 
    index and search (<link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</link>, 
    <link xlink:href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</link>) your content, which
    can then be queried and clustered by &PROD;
  </para>

  <xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="introduction-workflow.xml" /> 

  <para>
    <xref linkend="chapter.faq" /> answers the questions most frequently asked
    on &PROD; mailing lists, it can also serve as a question-based index to the
    rest of this manual. <xref linkend="chapter.application-suite" />
    introduces applications available in &PROD; distribution and <xref
    linkend="chapter.getting-started" /> shows how to quickly set up &PROD; to
    cluster your own data. <xref linkend="chapter.tuning" /> discusses topics related
    to tuning &PROD; clustering, while <xref linkend="chapter.customizing" /> shows 
    how to customize &PROD; applications. <xref linkend="chapter.advanced-topics" /> covers
    some more advanced use cases of &PROD; and <xref linkend="chapter.troubleshooting" />
    provides solutions to common problems. Finally, <xref linkend="chapter.architecture" /> discusses
    &PROD; architecture and internals, while <xref linkend="chapter.components"/> 
    is an in-depth reference of &PROD; components.
