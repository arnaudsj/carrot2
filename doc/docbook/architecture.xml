    This chapter discusses some &C2; architecture assumptions, internals and

    <title>&C2; architecture overview</title>

    <para>
      This section provides a very brief overview of &C2; architecture. If you would like us
      to cover some specific topic in more detail, please

      <title>Processing component pipeline</title>

      <para>
        Processing in &C2; is based on a pipeline of processing components. The two main
        types of &C2; processing components are:

          <formalpara>
            <title>Document Sources</title>
            
            <para>
              provide data 
              for further processing. In a typical scenario, such a component would fetch
              search results from e.g. an external search engine, Lucene / Solr index or
              an <link linkend="section.architecture.input-xml">XML file</link>. Currently,
              &C2; distribution contains 12 different document source components.

            <title>Clustering Algorithms</title>
            
            <para>
              organize documents provided by document sources
              into meaningful groups. Currently, two specialized clustering algorithms are
              available in &C2;: <link linkend="section.component.lingo">Lingo</link> and 
              <link linkend="section.component.stc">STC</link>. Additionally, a number of 
              "synthetic" clustering algorithms are available, such as 
              <link linkend="section.component.url">by URL clustering</link>.

      <para>
        &C2; applications, such as &DCW; or &DCS; operate on a pipeline consisting of one
        document source and one clustering algorithm, but using &C2; Java API you can
        insert additional components at any point in the pipeline. Currently, the only
        component not falling into the above categories is a component for
        computing certain cluster quality metrics, but more components
        may be added in the future, e.g. for spell checking of user queries.

    <section xml:id="section.architecture.overview.component-attributes">
      <title>Processing component attributes</title>

      <para>
        The behavior of both document sources and clustering algorithms depends on a 
        number of attributes (settings) such as the number of documents to fetch or the number
        of clusters to produce. 
        The way you provide attribute values for specific components depends on the
        &C2; application you are working with:
      </para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <formalpara>
            <title>&DCW;.</title>
            <para>
              In &DCW; you can provide attributes for document sources (such as number
              of results to fetch or preferred results language) before you issue a query
              in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> view.
              Clustering algorithm attributes you can change using the sliders in the
              <guilabel>Attributes</guilabel> view. 
            </para>
          </formalpara>
        </listitem>
          
        <listitem>
          <formalpara>
            <title>&DCS;.</title>
            <para>
              In &DCS;, you can provide attribute values as additional parameters in the
              POST request. Name of the POST parameter should be the identifier of the
              attribute you want to set (see <xref linkend="chapter.components" /> for
              attribute identifiers). &C2; will attempt to convert the string value of the
              parameter to the required type (integer, float etc.).
