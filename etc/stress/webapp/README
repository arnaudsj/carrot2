How to put some load on the webapp?
===================================

PREPARATION

Extract sample queries from Carrot2 logs:

extract-queries.rb /path/to/logs/c2-logs* | sort -u | shuf > queries

Edit the replay script and define algorithms and sources you wish
to involve in the stress test (some of them perhaps should be spared so that
we don't put too much traffic on smaller search engines)

vi stress.rb


LOAD TESTING

Run the replay script, piping queries pool to pick from.

cat queries | ./stress.rb -t 5 -m 5

(see ./stress.rb -h for help)


REDEPLOY TESTING

Seeking memory leaks? Try this: edit properties in stress_redeploy.sh
to match your configuration. Start catalina (Tomcat) with jpda or some
other form of profiling.

Start the script and observe memory consumption. We experimented with
the following options:

-Djavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory=org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl 
-verbose:gc 
-XX:MaxPermSize=64m
-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrentAndUnloadsClasses 
-XX:+PrintGCDetails 
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC 
-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled 
-XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled
