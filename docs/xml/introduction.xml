        <title>What is &carrot;?</title>
        
        <para>
        &carrot; is an open source framework for search results clustering and
        other text-mining applications. The project was initially written by Dawid Weiss and
        Stanisław Osiński
        for academic purposes, but evolved into a production-quality software comparable to
        commercial products on the market.

        <para>
        A spin-off commercial company &carrotsearch; provides even more efficient and scalable
        search results clustering solutions based on (and smoothly integrated) with the open source 
        code.

        <title>About this manual</title>
        
        <para>This manual discusses the basic concepts behind internal &carrot; architecture. The project
        is mainly developer-based and as such no verbose documentation is written as it would always
        lag behind the codebase. If you have questions or concerns, it is best to contact
        the authors via the official project mailing list and ask directly.
